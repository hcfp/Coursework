# **Password Suite**

## Password Manager

* Database to store password associated with an account (not username)
  * e.g Account : Google, Password : Password123
    * AccountPassword(__AccountName__ , Password)

* Password must be stored securely so the database will be encrypted
  * [Wikipedia link on database encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_encryption)
  * Most existing password managers use AES-256
* A username and password provided by the user is used to access this database
  * Alternatively a password could be generated that uses words (which a human can remember)
    which is different to the type of passwords generated by the Password Generator

* Two-factor authentication could be used for further security

## Password Generator

[Wikipedia on random password generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_password_generator)

* Ability to generate passwords
* Passwords will consist of [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and special characters of custom length (minimum length of 8)
* Option to pick which common password rules to follow (must contain number, must contain special character etc.)
* Or more complex algorithms could be used

## Password Tester

[Summary of popular methods](https://nulab-inc.com/blog/nulab/password-strength)

* User enters a password which is then tested using a variety of methods
* Test the password against common word lists
* Show how often the password appears in multiple word list to give an indication   as to how likely they are to be cracked
* Test for repeated characters and common sequences (probably in word lists)
* Suggest improvements to user when a common fault is found in the password
